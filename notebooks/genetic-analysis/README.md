## üóÇÔ∏è Data Files

### `sample_genetic_data.csv`
Sample genetic sequence data with:
- Sequence ID and DNA sequence
- Species and genome assembly information
- Risk scores and classifications
- GC content and sequence metrics

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install required packages (run in notebook)
pip install kafka-python pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn biopython requests
```

### Environment Setup
The notebooks are configured to work with:
- **Kafka Cluster**: `genetic-data-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.healthcare-ml-demo.svc.cluster.local:9092`
- **Topics**: 
  - `genetic-data-raw` (input)
  - `genetic-data-annotated` (output)
- **VEP Service**: Independent annotation service
- **KEDA Scalers**: Configured for auto-scaling

### Running the Notebooks

1. **Start with Notebook 1**: Basic genetic analysis and ML model training
2. **Move to Notebook 2**: Real-time Kafka processing and scaling
3. **Use Notebook 3**: Monitor costs and scaling patterns

## üéØ Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic ML Analysis
- Run notebook 1 to demonstrate genetic risk prediction
- Show model training and evaluation
- Visualize genetic sequence patterns

### Scenario 2: Real-time Processing
- Use notebook 2 to send genetic data to Kafka
- Monitor VEP service processing
- Trigger scaling events with large batches

### Scenario 3: Cost Monitoring
- Run notebook 3 to monitor resource usage
- Generate cost reports
- Analyze scaling impact on costs

## üîß Integration Points

### Kafka Integration
- **Producer**: Sends genetic sequences to `genetic-data-raw` topic
- **Consumer**: Receives annotated results from `genetic-data-annotated` topic
- **VEP Service**: Processes sequences and adds annotations

### KEDA Scaling
- **Kafka Lag Scaler**: Scales VEP service based on message lag
- **CPU/Memory Scalers**: Scales based on resource usage
- **Custom Metrics**: Supports custom scaling triggers

### Cost Attribution
- **Resource Monitoring**: Tracks CPU and memory usage
- **Cost Calculation**: Estimates costs based on usage
- **Scaling Impact**: Shows cost changes during scaling events

## üìä Expected Outputs

### Machine Learning Results
- Risk prediction accuracy: ~85-90%
- Feature importance rankings
- Confusion matrices and performance metrics

### Scaling Demonstrations
- Pod scaling from 1 to 3+ replicas
- Message processing rate improvements
- Cost attribution changes

### Cost Analysis
- Hourly cost estimates: $0.10-0.50/hour
- Component-level cost breakdown
- Scaling impact on total costs

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Kafka Connection Issues
```python
# Check Kafka connectivity
KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS = 'genetic-data-cluster-kafka-bootstrap.healthcare-ml-demo.svc.cluster.local:9092'
```

### VEP Service Issues
- Ensure VEP service is running and healthy
- Check topic configuration and message format
- Verify KEDA scalers are active

### Resource Monitoring
- OpenShift API access may be limited in notebook environment
- Some metrics are simulated for demonstration purposes
- Real production deployment would use OpenShift monitoring APIs

## üéâ Demo Tips

1. **Start Small**: Begin with small batches to show basic functionality
2. **Scale Up**: Gradually increase batch sizes to trigger scaling
3. **Monitor Costs**: Use cost monitoring to show real-time attribution
4. **Show Integration**: Demonstrate end-to-end pipeline from notebook to VEP service
5. **Highlight Benefits**: Emphasize scale-to-zero, cost efficiency, and real-time processing
